## Personal Projects.

- Coming soon.

## Domain-Specific Knowledge

### Data-Type Specialization

- You may want to specialize in a specific type of AI discipline, for instance Computer Vision, or Natural Language Processing. This can set you appart from other Data Scientists, and increase your chance to get a first job for these specific types of ML Systems. You could also decide to stay generalist.

- If you want to specialize, for instance in Natural Language Processing, take one extra specialisation course such as the [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/natural-language-processing-specialization/) from Deeplearning.ai

### Domain-specific Knowledge

- This is for instance, your background in Materials Science, Finance, Law, Genetics, Medicine, etc... It is great to leverage from your background and try to get your first job by applying Machine Learning in this particular domain you are already familiar with. This gives a significant advantage to you versus the other Junior Data Scientists who have not this domain-specific knowledge.

- But no worries if you do not have such background, you can learn that too! You could also decide to focus on a specific domain-knowledge you are interested in, and take any intro course provided for free by Universities, on Youtube, Edx platform, or Coursera.

- *For instance, if you are interested in Space Missions and Astronatics, here are some great course:*
  - [EPFL - Space Mission Design and Operations](https://www.edx.org/course/space-mission-design-and-operations)
  - [MIT - Introduction to Aerospace Engineering and Astronautics](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-aerospace-engineering-astronautics)


Note: and English, of course!
