# Data Science Roadmap

## 5 Pillars
- Python Programming for Machine Learning
- Mathematics
- Software Engineering Basics
- Soft Skills / Buisness
- Domain-specific knowledge (recommanded)

## Master the Basics:

### Mathematics:
1. [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization/) (50-80 hrs)

## Python for Machine Learning
1. [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) (100-150 hrs)
2. [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4) (100-150 hrs)
3. [Machine Learning with Python Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/) (60-70 hrs)

## Software Engineering
- Git
- python package manager + creation of virtual environment (e.g. miniconda, anaconda)
- Programming software: Visual Studio Code, Spyder

Optional / Nice to know:
- Google Colab
- Kaggle





Toolset:
-

Note: and English, of course!



## Advanced Level Data Science

- [MIT Online Course: Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data) (160-220 hrs)

- [MIT Online Course: Fondamentals of Statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-statistics) (180-240 hrs)




You need to have a solid understanding of the basics (master high-school level (Lyc√©e)) in 
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Linear Agebra (Matrix calculus, systems of linear equations)
- Probabilities and Statistics.
